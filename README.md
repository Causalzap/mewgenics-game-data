# 🧬 Mewgenics Game Data (Community Edition)

This repository contains structured JSON/CSV data extracted from *Mewgenics* game files. It is intended for developers, theory-crafters, and wiki maintainers.

## 📂 Dataset Contents

* **`traits.json`**: All cat traits with their hidden stat modifiers.
* **`mutations.json`**: Full list of mutations, diseases, and their dominant/recessive flags.
* **`bosses.json`**: HP, ranges, and ability sets for known bosses.

## 🚀 Visualization & Tools

Raw data is hard to read. If you want to **visualize** this data or calculate probabilities (Luck/RNG), please use the Strategy Engine we built:

> **👉 [MewGenius.com - Strategy Engine & Calculator](https://mewgenius.com)**

The website includes:
* **Luck Calculator** (Simulates the hidden Reroll mechanics found in this data)
* **Breeding Simulator** (Uses the dominant/recessive flags from `mutations.json`)
* **Interactive Boss Guides**
